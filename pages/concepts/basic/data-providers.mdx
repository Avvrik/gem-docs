# Data Providers

A Data Provider is an entity that receives a share of the profit that is due to the [Pool](/concepts/protocol/pools).
It can be either the Pool owner or any other address, for additional security.

The pool owner is responsible for attracting liquidity providers to the Pool, as well as for hiring and managing
[feed providers](/concepts/basic/feed-providers) and other participants who populate the Pool with data related to
[Conditions](/concepts/protocol/conditions) and ensuring timely and correct provision of betting odds.

In contracts infrastructure, the Data Provider is represented as an address to which a part of the profit share
[is credited](/concepts/basic/fees-and-rewards) by [LP](/contracts/lp) after the completion of each Condition.
