Here, we'll configure the essential components of the SDK to enable proper functionality for the hooks.

## Providers

To start, the initial step involves setting up a Chain Provider with the network configuration. This provider informs other sections of the SDK about the current chain being used and also enables network change functionality.

For further details, refer to the [Chain](/sdk/providers/chain) section.

```ts {1, 13, 15}
import { ChainProvider } from '@azuro-org/sdk'
import { WagmiConfig, createConfig } from 'wagmi'
import { polygonMumbai } from 'viem/chains'


const wagmiConfig = createConfig(config)

function Providers(props: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const { children } = props

  return (
    <WagmiConfig config={wagmiConfig}>
      <ChainProvider initialChainId={polygonMumbai.id}>
        {children}
      </ChainProvider>
    </WagmiConfig>
  )
}
```

<Callout type="warning">
  The ChainProvider requires access to the Wagmi context.
</Callout>


Within the SDK, we utilize Data Hooks to fetch data from the subgraph. For this purpose, initializing the ApolloProvider is necessary.

For further details, refer to the [Apollo](/sdk/providers/apollo) section.

```ts {1-5, 20, 22}
// For Next.js application
import { ApolloProvider } from '@azuro-org/sdk/nextjs/apollo'

// For React application
import { ApolloProvider } from '@azuro-org/sdk/react/apollo'

import { ChainProvider } from '@azuro-org/sdk'
import { WagmiConfig, createConfig } from 'wagmi'
import { polygonMumbai } from 'viem/chains'


const wagmiConfig = createConfig(config)

function Providers(props: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const { children } = props

  return (
    <WagmiConfig config={wagmiConfig}>
      <ChainProvider initialChainId={polygonMumbai.id}>
        <ApolloProvider>
          {children}
        </ApolloProvider>
      </ChainProvider>
    </WagmiConfig>
  )
}
```

<Callout type="warning">
  The ApolloProvider requires access to the chain context.
</Callout>

After completing the providers setup, you can begin using the [Data Hooks](/sdk/data-hooks/useGames) and  the [Write Hooks](/sdk/write-hooks/usePrepareBet).

## Watchers

In your application, it's important to respond to changes in odds and condition statuses. Watchers play a key role in this process by subscribing to new contract events and signaling dependent hooks.

```ts
import { useWatchers } from '@azuro-org/sdk'

export function Watchers() {
  useWatchers()

  return null
}
```

After completing the watchers setup, you can begin using the [Watch Hooks](/sdk/watch-hooks/useOutcome).


## NB: Don't forget to tweak the following to customize AzuroSDK

1. **Chain ID**: Ensure you are using the correct chainId for the chain you intend to interact with.
2. **Project ID**: For wallet connections, such as WalletConnect, replace the placeholder with your actual project ID from walletconnect.com.
3. **RPC URLs**: In the `rpcUrls` object, provide the actual RPC URLs for the chains you're using.
