# Contracts

In the current version of the Azuro Protocol, there are several contracts available. Of these contracts, the ones that are
most commonly used in front-end development are the `LP` (Liquidity Pool) and `Core` contracts.

The `LP` contract is considered to be the heart of the Azuro Protocol. It is responsible for managing liquidity
providers and user bets.

The `Core` contract contains the entire betting logic and is related to the `LP` contract.

It's worth noting that the `Core` contract is an important component of the Azuro Protocol and is responsible for managing
various aspects of the betting process, such as handling user balances, calculating odds, and resolving bets.


## Avoid Duplications

There can be several `LP` contracts within a single blockchain network. There are several reasons for this, such as
managing different currency pools or addressing risk management concerns.

Each `LP` contract can contain multiple `Core` contracts, with each `Core` contract differing in terms of the logic
used for different casino games or pre-match/live betting. For example, the logic for pre-match/live betting may
differ from that used for other casino games.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  The presence of multiple identical contracts in the Azuro Protocol can lead to entities with the same IDs. This is
  because entities created on different contracts may share the same ID, which can make it difficult to distinguish between them.

  For example, different `LP`s may have the same games with the same `gameId`, while conditions created on `Core` contracts
  may have the same `conditionId`.

When interacting with entities in the Azuro Protocol, it's important to use the `coreAddress` and `lpAddress` properties
to identify the specific contract to which the entity belongs.

For example, when querying for games, you should include the `lpAddress` as a filter to ensure that you are only retrieving
games from the correct `LP` contract. Similarly, when placing bets, you should include the `coreAddress` to ensure that
the bet is being placed on the correct `Core` contract.

By using these additional properties to identify the specific contract and entity, you can help prevent issues related
to duplicate IDs and ensure that your application is able to function as intended.

## More Info

### LP
Liquidity Pool (LP) is an ERC721 non-fungible token that broadens the standardized specification by including bets and
provides liquidity features, based on the `Core` contract. Each `LPNFT` token represents a liquidity part added by each
user. `LPNFT` can be withdrawn by users at any moment, getting their part of shared liquidity including profit/loss.
User’s liquidity used in the protocol only from the moment it was added.

### Core
The Core contract consists of the whole betting logic of the Azuro Protocol. It is responsible for correct odds
calculation and its slippage. It resolves bettor's prizes and losses.

### LiveCore
The LiveCore contract consists of the whole live betting logic of the Azuro Protocol. It collects live bets into
groups - batches and calculates odds for all bets in a batch. It rejects bets with "minimal odds" higher than batch
odds. It also resolves bettor's prizes and losses.

### Factory
The Factory contract creates a set of `LP` and `Core` contracts, configures them, and links them to the `AzuroBet` contract.

### AzuroBet
AzuroBet is the ERC1155 Non-Fungible Token (NFT) that represents bets made at the Azuro Protocol. Bettors own an
"amount" of token ID and can withdraw the "payout" of the owned token in case of a win. The token ID represents the
condition and outcome index, so every condition has only two token IDs (for conditions with two outcomes). It can be
transferred by users and sold on the secondary market. This feature allows users to create P2P live betting, and these
NFTs can also be collected by users as memorable bets. Minting and Burning of these tokens are controlled by the `Core`
contract.
