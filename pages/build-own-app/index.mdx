# Build Your Own Bookmaker App

Welcome to the Azuro documentation on building your own application using our protocol.

The Azuro protocol is built on top of the blockchain, and currently runs on both the Gnosis and Polygon chains.
You do not need a deep understanding of smart contracts, nor do you need to write or deploy them. The protocol provides
a complete ecosystem, allowing you to use Web3 and RPC to fetch data and call smart contract methods to interact with the blockchain.

Fetching data from the blockchain can be tricky, especially when using historical nodes to obtain outdated data, while
also fetching additional data from contracts and adjusting IPFS data. To simplify this process and make it more efficient,
Azuro provides Subgraphs (GraphQL) to fetch all the necessary data for building a complete bookmaker application.

To build your application, you will need good coding expertise, experience using GraphQL, an understanding of Web3, and RPC.
With these tools, you can build a robust, decentralized application on top of the Azuro protocol, leveraging the latest
in blockchain technology to create a trustless and secure platform for your users.
