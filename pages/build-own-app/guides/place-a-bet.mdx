# Place a Bet

To place bets there are 2 methods on `LP` contract: `bet` and `betNative`.

`betNative` should be used when placing bets in native token, as example xDAI in Gnosis chain. On other hand `bet`
method is used for non-native tokens like USDC in Polygon.

```ts
bet(
  core: string,
  amount: BigNumberish,
  expiresAt: BigNumberish,
  betData: IBet.BetDataStruct,
  overrides?: Overrides & { from?: string }
): Promise<ContractTransaction>
```

```ts
betNative(
  core: string,
  expiresAt: BigNumberish,
  betData: IBet.BetDataStruct,
  overrides?: PayableOverrides & { from?: string }
): Promise<ContractTransaction>
```

## Usage

```ts
import * as ethers from 'ethers'

const data = ethers.utils.defaultAbiCoder.encode(
  [ 'uint256', 'uint64', 'uint64' ],
  [ conditionId, outcomeId, minOdds ]
)

betNative(coreAddress, deadline, {
  affiliate,
  data,
}, { value: rawAmount })

bet(coreAddress, rawAmount, deadline, {
  affiliate,
  data,
})
```

To clarify, `conditionId` and `outcomeId` values should be taken from the specific outcome that the user is placing
their bet on within the game. These IDs can be obtained by iterating through the outcomes array of the Game object and
finding the relevant outcome that the user has selected.

Additionally, the `coreAddress` value should be the address of the `Core` contract that is associated with the `LP`
contract that the user is betting on. Each condition entity has `coreAddress` field containing this value.

```graphql
query Game($id: String!) {
  game(id: $id) {
    liquidityPool {
      address
    }
    conditions {
      conditionId
      coreAddress
      outcomes {
        outcomeId
        odds
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `minOdds` parameter is used to specify the minimum odds value at which the bet can be placed. If the current odds
value is lower than the specified value, the bet cannot be placed and will be rejected by the contract.

To calculate the minimum odds, you can use the slippage factor. The slippage factor is the percentage by which
the current odds can change in a smaller direction.

For example, if the current odds for an outcome is 2, and the user sets a slippage factor of 5%, then the minimum odds
that the user will accept is 1.9 (2 * 0.95). This ensures that the user's bet is not accepted if the odds fall below
the minimum acceptable value.

The slippage factor can be specified by the user in the interface and then passed as a parameter to the bet method.

```ts
const currentOdds = 1.5 // the odds value taken from contracts in the moment of bet placing
const slippage = 5 // 5%
const minOdds = 1 + (currentOdds - 1) * (100 - slippage) / 100
```

The betting methods accept BigNumberish value for `minOdds`.

```ts
import { parseUnits } from '@ethersproject/units'

const oddsDecimals = 12 // current protocol version odds has 12 decimals
const rawMinOdds = parseUnits(minOdds, oddsDecimals)
```

`deadline` is a parameter that specifies the deadline by which the transaction must be included in a block. If the
transaction is not included in a block before the deadline, the transaction will revert. The value of this parameter
should be passed in seconds.

```ts
const currentTime = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000)
const deadline = currentTime + 2000 // the bet should be accepted within the next 2000 seconds
```

`affiliate` is an address of crypto wallet where the rewards for user referrals should be transferred.

## The Real App Example

```ts
import * as ethers from 'ethers'
import { parseUnits } from '@ethersproject/units'

// some outcome data
const outcome = {
  lpAddress: '...',
  coreAddress: '...',
  conditionId: '...',
  outcomeId: '...',
  odds: '...',
}

const lpContract = new ethers.Contract(outcome.lpAddress, LP_ABI, RPC_PROVIDER)

const deadline = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 2000
const affiliate = '...'

const betAmount = 100 // 100 xDAI
const tokenDecimals = 18 // xDAI has 18 decimals
const rawAmount = parseUnits(betAmount, tokenDecimals)

const slippage = 5
const minOdds = 1 + (outcome.odds - 1) * (100 - slippage) / 100
const rawMinOdds = parseUnits(minOdds, 12)

const data = ethers.utils.defaultAbiCoder.encode(
  [ 'uint256', 'uint64', 'uint64' ],
  [ outcome.conditionId, outcome.outcomeId, rawMinOdds ]
)

// if chain is Gnosis then place bets in xDAI native token
if (appChainId === Gnosis.chainId) {
  lpContract.betNative(outcome.coreAddress, deadline, {
    affiliate,
    data,
  }, { value: rawAmount })
}
else {
  lpContract.bet(outcome.coreAddress, rawAmount, deadline, {
    affiliate,
    data,
  })
}
```

It's important to ensure that the user has sufficient funds in their account before placing a bet, and to handle errors
gracefully if the bet cannot be placed due to insufficient funds or other reasons.

Keeping the odds updated is essential for providing the best user experience to your customers. By
[subscribing to odds updates](/guides/real-time-odds-updates), you can keep the odds values up-to-date in real-time,
which can help reduce the risk of user frustration or missed betting opportunities. Alternatively, you can
[fetch the odds values](/guides/get-odds-values) before a user submits a bet to ensure that the odds values are current
at the time of the bet placement.
