## Place a single bet using native token

To perform actions with native token you should use [ProxyFront](/contracts/proxy-front) contract.

  Some conditions have restrictions and cannot be used in a combo bet, for example, eSports conditions. To avoid this error you need check the `isExpressForbidden` field in condition subgraph data, if this field is `true` than you should forbid such combo bet and show warning notification in your ui.

## Highlights

### `conditionId` & `outcomeId`

To clarify, `conditionId` and `outcomeId` values should be taken from the specific outcome that the user is placing
their bet on within the game. These ids can be obtained by iterating through the outcomes array of the Game object and
finding the relevant outcome that the user has selected.

Additionally, the `prematchCoreAddress` value should be the address of the `Core` contract that is associated with the `LP`
contract that the user is betting on. Each condition entity has `prematchCoreAddress` field containing this value.

### `rawMinOdds`

The `minOdds` parameter is used to specify the minimum odds value at which the bet can be placed. If the current odds value is lower than the specified value, the bet cannot be placed and will be rejected by the contract.

To calculate the minimum odds, you can use the slippage factor. The slippage factor is the percentage by which the current odds can change in a smaller direction.

For example, if the current odds for an outcome is 2, and the user sets a slippage factor of 5%, then the minimum odds that the user will accept is 1.9 (2 * 0.95). This ensures that the user's bet is not accepted if the odds fall below the minimum acceptable value.

The slippage factor can be specified by the user in the interface and then passed as a parameter to the bet method.

```ts
const currentOdds = 1.5 // the odds value taken from contracts in the moment of bet placing
const slippage = 5 // 5%
const minOdds = 1 + (currentOdds - 1) * (100 - slippage) / 100
```

The betting methods accept `BigNumberish` value for `minOdds`.

```ts
const oddsDecimals = 12 // in current version of protocol odds has 12 decimals
const rawMinOdds = parseUnits(minOdds.toFixed(oddsDecimals), oddsDecimals)
```

### `deadline`

This parameter specifies the deadline by which the transaction must be included in a block. If the transaction is not included in a block before the deadline, the transaction will revert. The value of this parameter should be passed in seconds.

```ts
const currentTime = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000)
const deadline = currentTime + 2000 // the bet should be accepted within the next 2000 seconds
```

### `affiliate`

This is the wallet address where the rewards will be distributed. Please be aware that the accumulation of rewards is predicated on them being associated with this specific wallet. To receive your rewards directly into this wallet, you must redeem them accordingly. [Read about rewards distribution here](/concepts/basic/rewards).


## Recommendations

It's important to ensure that the user has sufficient funds in their account before placing a bet, and to handle errors
gracefully if the bet cannot be placed due to insufficient funds or other reasons.

Keeping the odds updated is essential for providing the best user experience to your customers. By
[subscribing to odds updates](/guides/real-time-odds-updates), you can keep the odds values up-to-date in real-time,
which can help reduce the risk of user frustration or missed betting opportunities. Alternatively, you can
[fetch the odds values](/guides/get-odds-values) before a user submits a bet to ensure that the odds values are current
at the time of the bet placement.
