# In a nutshell

**AzuroSDK** is your one-stop-shop for building a dApp on Azuro Protocol. Simply install it and youâ€™ll have a basic betting dApp which you can then [customize](sdk/setup) to your needs.

**AzuroSDK uses TypeScript and consists of:**
- An example project with all the necessary files for a betting dApp.
- A source code with React and Next.js components.
- Hooks for accessing the data through Apollo Client and GraphQL.

# Overview

Developing your own betting application using our guides and documentation often involves about a week's worth of effort due to the complexity of the logic involved. To streamline this process, we developed an SDK for quicker application development.

SDK provides a comprehensive collection of useful React hooks and utilities for creating your own betting application, eliminating the need to worry about the tedious setup details.

<Callout type="info">
In the future you can meet these types and in order not to repeat, we'll provide descriptions here.

- **Selection**: Represents the user's choise, main data for bet and odds calculation, etc.
- **Outcome**: Specific data, such as the user's bet (`BetOutcome`) that includes `Selection`.

```ts
type Selection = {
  conditionId: string | bigint
  outcomeId: string | bigint
}
```

```ts
type BetOutcome = {
  selectionName: string
  odds: number
  marketName: string
  game: GameQuery['games'][0]
  isWin: boolean | null
  isLose: boolean | null
  isCanceled: boolean
} & Selection
```
</Callout>
