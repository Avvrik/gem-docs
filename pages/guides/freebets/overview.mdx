# Freebets
A tool that enables granting freebets to any user.

- [Using freebets in the UI guide](/guides/freebets/use-freebets)

The Freebet contract enables users to place freebets on any [PrematchCore](/contracts/prematch-core) contract.
Each freebet has specific attributes, including a denomination, expiration time, and minimum betting odds requirement.

**Key notes:**
- Each Freebet contract is limited to a particular affiliate address to offer freebets exclusively to your
customers.
- Distribution of freebets doesn't lock any liquidity before claim. You can create as much freebets as you want (even if available balance doesn't cover total amount).
But we do not recommend abusing this feature: when trying to use the freebet, the customer will receive an error if the available balance is not enough.
- The Freebet distribution process is cost-effective for frontend operators (off-chain). Customers will pay the gas fees for the
`bet` transaction, and the claim fee will be included as part of this process. This reduces the operational
costs associated with distributing freebets.
- When a freebet is used by the customer, the amount of the freebet is transferred from contract balance to LP.
- If freebet isn't claimed before expiration time, it just becomes expired, doesn't require any actions and disappears from available freebets list for the customer in rest api.
[Read how to use freebets in UI](/guides/freebets/use-freebets).
- **When a freebet wins, the bettor receives only the difference between the winnings
and the original bet amount.** The amount of the freebet will be returned to your contract balance.
- If a freebet looses, it's accounted as a regular bet - the amount remains in the liquidity pool as a revenue.

  1. Distribute a freebet for 5 WXDAI.\
  _Contract balance isn't changed._

  _Contract balance is reduced for bet amount - 5 WXDAI transferred to the LP._
  3. Bet wins, after redeeming:\
  _The customer will receive: 2.5 WXDAI._\
  _Your freebet contract will receive: 5 WXDAI._
