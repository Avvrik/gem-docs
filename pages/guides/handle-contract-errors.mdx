# Handle errors from contracts
To understand why placing or redeeming bet transaction may be reverted, it's highly recommended to handle errors.

In most cases of operation fail, contracts return an error code
(which is a hex - 4-byte error call selector of error name, for example, `0xfd25ed88` = `SmallOdds` from the Core contract).

You can log and handle these errors for a better UX (show to your user what exactly went wrong) and support.
All errors are included in contracts ABI.

<Callout type="info">
  Please note, the error can be transmitted from different ABI for a transaction and may be nested in a sublevel of an error.
  E.g. "bet" in ProxyFront may return an error from ProxyFront, LP or Core (Prematch / Express).
</Callout>

### Example of universal getter of contract error (wagmi/viem)

```ts copy filename=getContractErrorInfo.ts
import { decodeErrorResult, isHex } from 'viem'
import { coreABI, expressABI, freebetABI, proxyFrontABI, lpABI } from 'path/to/abi'

const abis = [ coreABI, expressABI, lpABI, freebetABI, proxyFrontABI ]

const getContractErrorHashFromError = (error: any): string | undefined => {
  if (error?.version && /viem/.test(error.version)) {
    const code = error?.data

    if (!isHex(code) && error?.cause) {
      return getContractErrorHashFromError(error.cause)
    }

    return code
  }
}

export default function getContractErrorInfo(error: any) {
  const hex = getContractErrorHashFromError(error)

  if (!isHex(hex)) {
    return {
      hex: null,
      name: null,
    }
  }

  let foundErrorName = null

  abis.some((abi) => {
    try {
      const { errorName } = decodeErrorResult({
        abi,
        data: hex,
      })

      foundErrorName = errorName
    }
    catch {}

    return foundErrorName
  })

  return {
    hex,
    name: foundErrorName,
  }
}
```

## Some contract errors description

#### SmallOdds
`0xfd25ed88` = `SmallOdds`

Core contracts (prematch/express) calculates odds for a bet on thy fly. This error means that final odds are lower than passed `minOdds` param.

We recommend to calculate odds with amount of bet and add a slippage before customer sent the placing bet transaction.

#### TooLargeReinforcement
`0x46980695` = `TooLargeReinforcement(uint256 conditionId)`

This error from ExpressCore, the maximum possible winnings for one Condition in all bets are limited to a fixed amount.
See details in [Contracts section](/contracts/bet-express).
If it's thrown, it means that limit is reached and all combo bets with this condition can't be accepted anymore.
