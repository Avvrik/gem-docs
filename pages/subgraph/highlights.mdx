### Limits

TheGraph has a limit of returning a maximum of 1000 elements per request, with a default of 100 elements. Keep this
limit in mind when building your queries. [Read how to paginate](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/querying/graphql-api/#pagination).

### IDs

TheGraph uses a unique `id: ID!` (TheGraph Ids) for @entity directives in schemas. These ids are technical and do not
correspond to Azuro entities. Azuro entities use prefixes in their ids (Azuro Ids), such as `sportId` for sports
and `gameId` for games. Avoid using `id` if it is not necessary.

### Addresses

When working with Subgraphs, all address values are stored in lowercase. This means that when passing variables to
queries, it's important to convert the transmitted value to lowercase, or use the `_contains_nocase` postfix.

### Entity Duplications

There can be several `LP` contracts within a single blockchain network. There are several reasons for this, such as
managing different currency pools or addressing risk management concerns.

Each `LP` contract can contain multiple `Core` contracts, with each `Core` contract differing in terms of the logic
used for different casino games or pre-match/live betting. For example, the logic for pre-match/live betting may
differ from that used for other casino games.

  The presence of multiple identical contracts in the Azuro Protocol can lead to entities with the same IDs. This is
  because entities created on different contracts may share the same ID, which can make it difficult to distinguish between them.

  For example, different `LP`s may have the same games with the same `gameId`, while conditions created on `Core` contracts
  may have the same `conditionId`.

When interacting with entities in the Azuro Protocol, it's important to use the `coreAddress` and `lpAddress` properties
to identify the specific contract to which the entity belongs.

For example, when querying for games, you should include the `lpAddress` as a filter to ensure that you are only retrieving
games from the correct `LP` contract. Similarly, when placing bets, you should include the `coreAddress` to ensure that
the bet is being placed on the correct `Core` contract.

By using these additional properties to identify the specific contract and entity, you can help prevent issues related
to duplicate IDs and ensure that your application is able to function as intended.
