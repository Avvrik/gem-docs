# Get Bets History

## Bet Info

To get information about the user-placed bets, you can use the following GraphQL query

```graphql
query BetsHistory($where: Bet_Filter) {
  bets(where: $where) {
    betId # the NFT ID, the token given to the user for the exchange of placed tokens
    amount # the bet amount
    potentialPayout # the amount based on the bet odds to payout if the user's bet wins
    status # the bet status
    result # the state representing if the user wins or loses
    isRedeemable # the boolean field representing the state if the user can redeem the bet
    isRedeemed # the boolean field representing the state if the bet was redeemed by the user
    createdBlockTimestamp # the date when the bet was placed
    createdTxHash # the transaction hash of the block in which the bet was mined
    outcome { # contains the state of the outcome when the bet was placed
      outcomeId
      odds
    }
    game { # contains the information about the game the bet was placed on
      ...Game
    }
  }
}

fragment Game on Game {
  sport {
    name
  }
  league {
    name
    country {
      name
    }
  }
  participants {
    name
    image
  }
  startsAt
}
```

```ts
useQuery(QUERY, {
  variables: {
    where: {
      actor: account.toLowerCase(),
    },
  },
})
```

Note that the `where` variable is used to filter bets placed by a specific user account.


## Bet Status

The `status` field value is of type enum and has three states: `Accepted`, `Canceled`, and `Resolved`. Note that there is no
middle status similar to `Pending`. Until the outcome the bet was made on is resolved, the status of the bet will be
`Accepted`. If you need to have a status on when a game is in progress - `Live` then you need to extend status value
with using game `startsAt`.

```ts
const isGameStarted = Date.now() / 1000 >= +bet.game.startsAt
const isLive = isGameStarted && bet.status === BetStatus.Accepted
```

It's important to check if bet status is `Accepted` to handle the situation when game is finished and the results are resolved.
Note that in current version of the protocol there is no way to understand when game is finished. So the `Live` status will be
active until the game to be resolved.


## Bet Result

The `result` field value is of type enum and has three states: `Won`, `Lost`.

```ts
const isWon = bet.result === BetResult.Won
const isLost = bet.result === BetResult.Lost
```

Note that until the outcome is resolved `result` will be `null`.


## Market and Selection Names

```ts
import { getMarketName, getSelectionName } from '@azuro-org/dictionaries'

const marketName = getMarketName({ outcomeId: bet.outcome.outcomeId })
const selectionName = getSelectionName({ outcomeId: bet.outcome.outcomeId })
```

## Pagination

There can be a lot of bets from one user and there can be a problem with fetching all of them at once.

  TheGraph has a limit of returning a maximum of 1000 elements per request, with a default of 100 elements. Keep this
  limit in mind when building your queries. [Read how to paginate](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/querying/graphql-api/#pagination).

```graphql

```ts
const PAGE_SIZE = 100

const [ page, setPage ] = useState(1)

useQuery(QUERY, {
  variables: {
    skip: (page - 1) * PAGE_SIZE,
    first: PAGE_SIZE,
