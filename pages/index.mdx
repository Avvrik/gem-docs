# Azuro Protocol

<p className="mt-6">Azuro is building the base layer for decentralized betting where markets are priced, created, and made liquid. This is
achieved through mixing 3 of cryptoâ€™s main primitives: Prediction Markets, NFTs, and DAO governance, plus a new
Liquidity Pool design, called the Liquidity Tree.</p>
<p>The result is a slick betting feed with thousands of liquid markets, a rich feature set, and a clean UX.
Apps (a.k.a. Frontends) built on top of Azuro can provide players with a viable, trustless, decentralized alternative
to traditional online betting operators.</p>
<p>As a result, we envision a rich, fun betting environment with decreased cost of service to players, full transparency,
community-run, and with a commitment to responsibility.</p>
