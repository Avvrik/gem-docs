# Contracts

In current version Azuro Protocol has 6 contracts. The contracts that will be most used in front building are `LP`
and `Core`.

`LP` contract is the heart of Azuro Protocol. Liquidity Pool works with liquidity providers and users bets.

`Core` contract
consists the whole betting logic and relates to `LP` contract. There can be several `Core` contracts related to one `LP` contract.
