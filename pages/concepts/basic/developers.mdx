  subTitle="Azuro's design allows anyone to create new betting products or betting market derivatives using Azuro's infrastructure and liquidity"
/>

While Frontends can copy exisiting products and create new UIs with localization & specialization, more sophisticated
developers can go further and create new products altogether. Using new liqiudity pools and other overlays on top of
Azuro's infrastructure and underlying liquidity - various derivative products can be developed.

<Callout type="info">
  Despite the fact that the Azuro DAO has no control over whoever connects their front-end platforms with Azuro or
  creates new products based on Azuro, the Azuro DAO encourages those  who intend to do so to comply with any laws
  applicable to the operation of such platforms.

  The Azuro DAO expressly disclaims any liability for the activity of third parties who connect their platform with Azuro.
