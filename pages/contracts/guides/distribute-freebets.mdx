# Distribute Freebets

To get started with distributing FreeBets, follow these steps:

1. **Request FreeBet Contracts**: Begin by making a request to the Azuro Protocol team to create FreeBet
contracts for your use. Once approved, you will gain access to our Free Bets admin panel, and your new contracts
integrated into our subgraphs. As the contract owner, you have the flexibility to withdraw
funds from the marketing budget at any time. Additionally, FreeBet contracts will be deployed exclusively
for your affiliate address, ensuring that your funds are allocated solely to your frontend.

2. **Provide Liquidity**: To check the liquidity balance, use the `balanceOf(freebetAddress)` function on the token
contract. You can top up your contract by simply sending tokens to your contract address, just as you would with
a regular ERC-20 transfer.

3. **Withdraw Liquidity**: When you wish to withdraw liquidity from the contract, call the `withdrawReserve(amount)`
function. Keep in mind that only tokens not reserved for FreeBets can be withdrawn.
To release reserved tokens, use the `resolvePayout(freeBetIds[])` function, especially when customers have not
resolved their FreeBets (i.e., they haven't claimed their bets).

4. **Locked Reserve**: You can check the amount of locked tokens that cannot be withdrawn by using the `lockedReserve`
function on the FreeBet contract.

  We recommend limiting the IDs provided to the `resolvePayout` function parameters to avoid errors during transaction
  execution.
