Hook is used for fetch pre-match games.

Hook represents a logic wrapper over standard Apollo's `useQuery` hook. Explore [Apollo's docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/react/hooks#usequery) to understand what data the hooks return.

You can find the list of available sports [here](https://thegraph.azuro.org/subgraphs/name/azuro-protocol/azuro-api-polygon-v2/graphql?query=%7B%0A++sports+%7B%0A++++name%0A++%7D%0A%7D).

#### Usage

```ts
import { useGames, Game_OrderBy, OrderDirection } from '@azuro-org/data'

const { loading, error, data } = useGames(props)

const games = data?.games
```

#### Props

```ts
{
  filter?: {
    limit?: number // limit the number of rows returned from a query
    offset?: number // omit a specified number of rows before the beginning of the result set
    sportSlug?: string // returns games from specific sport
  }
  orderBy?: Game_OrderBy // default: Game_OrderBy.CreatedBlockTimestamp` - orders rows by passed rule
  orderDir?: OrderDirection // order direction: asc, desc
  cacheTime?: number // the frequency with which to update data, **measured in seconds**
}
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Numerous completed games exist in the Subgraph database. Displaying these already-initiated games in the pre-match list is generally unnecessary. To filter out such games, we employ the `startsAt_gt` parameter in the GraphQL query variables. This only retrieves games for which the `startsAt` time is later than `now()`.

  However, using the direct `now()` value for this parameter can be problematic as it can lead to frequent data re-fetches with each hook call. To mitigate this, we've introduced a caching mechanism that, by default, stores the results for 3 minutes. This caching duration can be modified by using the `cacheTime` parameter.

#### Custom query options

To accommodate additional arguments within your GraphQL query, the optimal approach is to create a custom hook. This can be achieved by leveraging the fundamental Apollo `useQuery` hook as your starting point.

```ts
import { useQuery } from '@apollo/client'
import type { GamesDocument, GamesQueryResult, GamesQueryVariables } from '@azuro-org/data'

const options = {
  // your options
}

const { loading, error, data } = useQuery<GamesQueryResult, GamesQueryVariables>(GamesDocument, options)
```

#### Return Value
```ts
{
  loading: boolean
  error: Error | null
  data: { 
    games: Array<{ 
      id: string
      gameId: any
      title?: string | null
      startsAt: any
      sport: { 
        slug: string
        name: string 
      }
      league: {
        slug: string
        name: string
        country: { 
          slug: string
          name: string 
        } 
      }
      participants: Array<{ 
        image?: string | null
        name: string 
      }>
    }> 
  }
}
```
