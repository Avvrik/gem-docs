# The Azuro Protocol

The Azuro Protocol is a decentralized protocol that enables peer-to-peer betting without intermediaries. It is built
on the Ethereum blockchain and consists of several smart contracts that handle different aspects of the betting process,
such as liquidity pools, betting conditions, live betting, and payouts. The protocol uses an automated market maker
to determine the odds of different outcomes and to ensure that the betting process is fair and transparent.
