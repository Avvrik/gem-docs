# Contracts

In the current version of the Azuro Protocol, there are several contracts available. Of these contracts, the ones that are
most commonly used in front-end development are the `LP` (Liquidity Pool) and `Core` contracts.

The `LP` contract is considered to be the heart of the Azuro Protocol. It is responsible for managing liquidity
providers and user bets.

The `Core` contract contains the entire betting logic and is related to the `LP` contract.

It's worth noting that the `Core` contract is an important component of the Azuro Protocol and is responsible for managing
various aspects of the betting process, such as handling user balances, calculating odds, and resolving bets.


## Avoid Duplications

There can be several `LP` contracts within a single blockchain network. There are several reasons for this, such as
managing different currency pools or addressing risk management concerns.

Each `LP` contract can contain multiple `Core` contracts, with each `Core` contract differing in terms of the logic
used for different casino games or pre-match/live betting. For example, the logic for pre-match/live betting may
differ from that used for other casino games.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  The presence of multiple identical contracts in the Azuro Protocol can lead to entities with the same IDs. This is
  because entities created on different contracts may share the same ID, which can make it difficult to distinguish between them.

  For example, different `LP`s may have the same games with the same `gameId`, while conditions created on `Core` contracts
  may have the same `conditionId`.

When interacting with entities in the Azuro Protocol, it's important to use the `coreAddress` and `lpAddress` properties
to identify the specific contract to which the entity belongs.

For example, when querying for games, you should include the `lpAddress` as a filter to ensure that you are only retrieving
games from the correct `LP` contract. Similarly, when placing bets, you should include the `coreAddress` to ensure that
the bet is being placed on the correct `Core` contract.

By using these additional properties to identify the specific contract and entity, you can help prevent issues related
to duplicate IDs and ensure that your application is able to function as intended.

## More Info

### LP

- Liquidity Pool is [ERC721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) non-fungible token which broadens the standardizes specification by including bets
and provides liquidity features, based on the Core contract.
- Every liquidity LPNFT token represents liquidity part added by each user.
- LPNFT can be withdrawn by user at any moment with getting its part of shared liquidity including profit/loss.
- User’s liquidity used in protocol only from moment it was added.

### Core

- Consists whole betting logic of Azuro Protocol.
- Response for correct odds calculation and it's slippage.
- Resolving bettor's prizes and loses.

### LiveCore

- Consists whole live betting logic of Azuro Protocol.
- Collecting live bets into groups - batches and calculate odds for all bets in batch. Rejects bets with
"minimal odds" higher to batch odds.
- Resolving bettor's prizes and loses.

### Factory

- Fabric contract creates set of LP, Core contracts, configures them and links to AzuroBet contract.

### AzuroBet

- AzuroBet is the [ERC1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155) Non fungible token,
that represents bets maid at Azuro Protocol.
- Bettor owns "amount" of token id and in case of win can withdraw "payout" of owned token.
- Token Id represents condition and outcome index, so every condition have only two token ids (for conditions
with two outcomes).
- It could be transferred by user and sell on the secondary market. This feature allow users to create p2p
live betting and also this NFT's could be collected by users as memorable bets.
- Minting and Burning of this tokens controlled by Core contract.
- Store bets register - lastTokenId.
