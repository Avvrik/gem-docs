# Dictionaries

Here you can find information about titles for outcomes, markets, etc.

## What is it?

Each game may have many markets and outcomes related to these markets, e.g. football event can have set of:

- Both Team To Score: Yes | No
- Full Time Result: 1 | 2
- etc

Blockchain doesn't store text information about outcomes. Each Outcome has `outcomeId`, Use it to get the information from
protocol dictionaries. "dictionaries" is set of files with text descriptions of specific outcome. Check [v2.0.2 dictionaries](https://github.com/Azuro-protocol/public-config/tree/main/dictionaries/v2.0.2/json/maps)
for a better understanding.

The work with dictionaries starts with `outcomes.json` file. This is the heart of dictionaries, this file contains the
decryption of the outcome ID in the form of other IDs: `selectionId`, `marketId`, `gamePeriodId`, `gameTypeId`, `gameVarietyId`,
`pointsId`, `teamPlayerId`. All text data about specific Outcome can be received using these IDs and the files related
to them it the repository.


```ts
const {
  selectionId,
  marketId,
  gamePeriodId,
  gameTypeId,
  gameVarietyId,
  pointsId,
  teamPlayerId
} = outcomes[outcomeId]

const selection = selections[selectionId]
const market = markets[marketId]
const gamePeriod = gamePeriods[gamePeriodId]
const gameType = gameTypes[gameTypeId]
const gameVariety = gameVarietys[gameVarietyId]
const points = points[pointsId]
const teamPlayer = teamPlayers[teamPlayerId]
```
