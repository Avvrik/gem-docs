# Freebets
A tool that enables granting free bets to any user. [Contract details](/contracts/free-bet)

The FreeBet contract enables users to place free bets on any [PrematchCore](/contracts/prematch-core) contract.
Each FreeBet has specific attributes, including a denomination, expiration time, and minimum betting odds requirement.
Additionally, each FreeBet contract is limited to a particular affiliate address to offer free bets exclusively to their
customers.

**Key notes:**
- Distribution of freebets doesn't lock any liquidity before claim. You can create as much freebets as you want (even if available balance doesn't cover total amount).
But we do not recommend abusing this feature: when trying to use the freebet, the customer will receive an error if the available balance is not enough.
- The FreeBet distribution process is cost-effective for frontend operators. Customers will cover the gas fees for the
`bet` transaction, and the claim fee will be included as part of this process. This reduces the operational
costs associated with distributing free bets.
- When a free bet is claimed by the customer, the amount of the free bet is transferred from contract balance to LP.
- If freebet isn't claimed before expiration time, it just becomes expired, doesn't require any actions and disappears from available freebets list for the customer in rest api.
[Read how to use freebets in UI](/guides/freebets/use-freebets).
- **When a free bet wins, the bettor receives only the difference between the winnings
and the original bet amount.** The amount of the free bet will be returned to your contract balance.

  Example of the flow:
  1. Distribute free bet amount: 5 USDT.\
  _Contract balance isn't changed_
  2. The customer places a bet on an outcome with odds 1.5. Potential payout: 7.5 USDT.\
  _Contract balance is reduced for bet amount - 5 USDT transferred to LP._
  3. Bet wins, after redeeming:
  - The customer will receive: 2.5 USDT (from the LP).
  - Your free bet contract will return: 5 USDT (from lockedReserve).

## Distribute Freebets

To get started with distributing FreeBets, follow these steps:

1. **Request FreeBet Contracts**: Begin by making a [request to the Azuro Protocol team](https://azuro.typeform.com/freebetpanel) to create FreeBet
contracts for your use. Once approved, you will gain access to our Free Bets admin panel, and your new contracts
integrated into our subgraphs. As the contract owner, you have the flexibility to withdraw
funds from the marketing budget at any time. Additionally, FreeBet contracts will be deployed exclusively
for your affiliate address, ensuring that your funds are allocated solely to your frontend.

2. **Provide Liquidity**: To check the liquidity balance, use the `balanceOf(freebetAddress)` function on the token
contract. You can top up your contract by simply sending tokens to your contract address, just as you would with
a regular ERC-20 transfer.

3. **Withdraw Liquidity**: When you wish to withdraw liquidity from the contract, call the `withdrawReserve(amount)`
function. Keep in mind that only tokens not reserved for FreeBets can be withdrawn.
To release reserved tokens, use the `resolvePayout(freeBetIds[])` function, especially when customers have not
resolved their FreeBets (i.e., they haven't claimed their bets).

4. **Locked Reserve**: You can check the amount of locked tokens that cannot be withdrawn by using the `lockedReserve`
function on the FreeBet contract.

<Callout type="info">
  We recommend limiting the IDs provided to the `resolvePayout` function parameters to avoid errors during transaction
  execution.
