# Overview

The main infrastructure of the protocol is formed by the following smart contracts:

- [Factory](/contracts/factory). Contains functions for deploying [Pools](/concepts/protocol/pools) and associated
Betting Engines. Owned by [Azuro DAO](/concepts/governance/overview).
- [LP](/contracts/lp). Serves as the main entry point for a Pool's logic. This contract contains all the core logic of
the Pool and the liquidity for providing bets. Owned by its creator.
- [Access](/contracts/access). Enables the Pool's owner to control access to the pool's contract functions.
Owned by the Pool's owner.
- [Betting Engines](/concepts/protocol/betting-engines). Encompass the logic of creating [Conditions](/concepts/protocol/conditions),
accepting bets, computing payouts for bets, and calculating [Rewards](/concepts/basic/rewards). These contracts can
be connected to the Pool by its owner in an unlimited number. Owned by the Pool's owner.

Additional tools that do not affect the Pool's logic:

- [FreeBet](/contracts/freebets). A tool that enables granting free bets to any user.
- [SafeOracle](/contracts/safe-oracle). Azuro dispute resolution system for Condition results.
