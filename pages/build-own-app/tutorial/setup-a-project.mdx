# Setup a Project

## Setup Next.js Project

In this guide we use React framework - Next.js. Don't worry if you are not familiar with Next.js. We will use it
as a boilerplate, there will be nothing in the installed project that can cause you difficulties in further coding.

Open your terminal, `cd` into the directory you’d like to create the project, and run the following command:

```bash copy
npx create-next-app@latest ./azuro-bookmaker-website
```

**Note!** During installation a terminal will prompt you with options to select. You need a very simple configuration
for this tutorial

- Would you like to use TypeScript with this project? … **No** / Yes
- Would you like to use ESLint with this project? … **No** / Yes
- Would you like to use `src/` directory with this project? … **No** / Yes
- Would you like to use experimental `app/` directory with this project? … **No** / Yes
- What import alias would you like configured? … @/* **(press Enter to skip)**

You now have a new directory called `azuro-bookmaker-website`. Let’s `cd` into it

```bash
cd azuro-bookmaker-website
```


## Styling

In this tutorial we will use [TailwindCSS](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/styling/tailwind-css) to apply CSS styles to UI.

Execute the following commands in the app root directory

```
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

Update **tailwind.config.js**. Add paths to the files that will use Tailwind CSS, add `.container` styles and breakpoints

```bash {4,7-17} copy
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./components/**/*.js",
    "./pages/**/*.js",
  ],
  theme: {
    container: {
      center: true,
      padding: '1rem',
      screens: {
        'sm': '600px',
        'md': '740px',
        'lg': '960px',
        'xl': '1024px',
        '2xl': '1280px',
      },
    },
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

Add the Tailwind CSS directives that Tailwind will use to inject its generated styles to a Global Stylesheet.

Replace the CSS code in `styles/globals.css` with

```css copy
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

To save time in the future, let's add some styles for the feature usage

```css copy {5-29}
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

@layer base {
  input[type="number"]::-webkit-inner-spin-button,
  input[type="number"]::-webkit-outer-spin-button {
    -webkit-appearance: none;
    margin: 0;
  }
}

@layer components {
  .button {
    @apply py-1.5;
    @apply px-4;
    @apply text-white;
    @apply bg-blue-700;
    @apply rounded-md;
  }

  .button[disabled] {
    @apply opacity-50;
    @apply cursor-not-allowed;
  }
}
```


## Dictionaries

The Azuro Protocol offers an NPM package called "dictionaries". This package provides text names for markets and
outcomes (selections). To learn more about using the "dictionaries" and how it can assist with texts, please
refer to [the documentation section](/build-own-app/dive-deeper/dictionaries).

```bash copy
npm install @azuro-org/dictionaries
```

Add new script to your `package.json`

```bash {5-6} filename="package.json" copy
"scripts": {
  "dev": "next dev",
  "build": "npm run get-dicts && next build",
  "start": "next start",
  "lint": "next lint",
  "get-dicts": "dictionaries -o ./dictionaries -v latest -t js"
}
```

Run the following command to download dictionaries

```bash copy
npm run get-dicts
```

This command will create a new folder in project`s root directory named "dictionaries" containing a set of js files.


## Packages

During development, you will need to install additional packages to ensure smooth progress. Please proceed by
installing the necessary packages

```bash copy
npm install dayjs @azuro-org/toolkit
```


## Components and Business Logic

Let's create two folders for organizing our project files: "components" for storing the components that will be created
during this tutorial and "hooks" for storing all the business logic

```bash copy
mkdir components hooks
```


## Clean Up

Let's clean up the application to prepare for the next steps.

1. Remove `styles/Home.module.css`
2. Remove `pages/api` folder
3. Replace code in `pages/index.js` with
```tsx copy
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main />
  )
}
```

**Great job! You have completed the setup and are now ready to dive into the exciting world of developing a betting
website on the Azuro protocol. Get creative, explore the possibilities, and build amazing!**
