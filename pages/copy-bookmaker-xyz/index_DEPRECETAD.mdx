### Setup environments

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` for development, and to `.env` for production usage. You don't need to change something.

### Configure texts (SEO)

Copy `dapp.config.js.example` to `dapp.config.js` and replace the texts.

### Run locally

Recommended engines are `Node 16.15.1`, `NPM 8.11.0`.

```
npm i
npm run dev
```

The application will be launched on `localhost:5001`.

### Production

```
npm run build
npm run start
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️️">
  We recommend to use [Vercel](https://vercel.com/build-own-app/guides/deploying-react-with-vercel) to deploy your project. It's very easy.

<Callout type="info" emoji="❤️">
  Azuro has a plan to create "Build, Execute and Deploy in One Click" instrument for your convenience.

### Caveat

<Callout type="error" emoji="⚠️">
  Don't change project code if you'd like to receive updates from Azuro team. With each update you will need to copy
  `dapp.config.js` and env files to new project. As a feature we will provide an API to make updating very easy :)
