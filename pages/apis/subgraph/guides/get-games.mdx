# Get Games

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  We highly recommend reading the ["GraphQL" section](/build-own-app/reference/graphql) first.
</Callout>

There are two ways to obtain a list of sport events: fetching games grouped by sport or fetching all games and then
grouping them by sport.

However, there may be situations where you need to retrieve the top 10 games for all sports. In this case, you would
need to make a request to fetch a list of all games, as GraphQL does not provide a way to directly filter results by sport.
After retrieving the list of games, you can then group them by sport to obtain the top 10 games for each sport.

## Fetch Games

```graphql
query Games {
  games {
    ...Game
  }
}

fragment Game on Game {
  sport {
    name
  }
  league {
    name
    country {
      name
    }
  }
  participants {
    name
    image
  }
  startsAt
}
```

The `Game` fragment contains the main fields that are needed to display a list of games to users.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Requesting all games, including those that have long been over, can put unnecessary strain on the GraphQL node and
  cause performance issues. In general, it's best to only request the data that you need for your application.

### Filter games by start date

If you only need to display games that are currently in progress or scheduled to start in the future, you can use the
`startsAt` field in the query to filter out games that have already ended. For example, you could modify the query to
only retrieve games that are scheduled to start in future:

```ts
useQuery(QUERY, {
  variables: {
    where: {
      startsAt_gt: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000),
    },
  },
})
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ">
  Note that the value is calculated in seconds.
</Callout>

### Filter games by `LP` address

Since Subgraphs contain data from different `LP` contracts, it's possible to have duplicated games across multiple
`LP` contracts. In order to avoid issues related to duplicated data, it's important to identify which `LP` contract
your application will interact with and use the corresponding address to filter the data. This ensures that only relevant
data is retrieved and reduces the risk of conflicts and errors. It's recommended to carefully consider which `LP`
contract to use based on your specific use case and business requirements. [Get more information](/build-own-app/reference/contracts#avoid-duplications).

```ts
useQuery(QUERY, {
  variables: {
    where: {
      liquidityPool_: {
        address: LP_ADDRESS,
      },
    },
  },
})
```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  From ["GraphQL" section](/reference/graphql#specificity):

  _When working with Subgraphs, all address values are stored in lowercase. This means that when passing variables to
  queries, it's important to convert the transmitted value to lowercase, or use the `_contains_nocase` postfix._
</Callout>

### Get games with active outcomes

```ts
useQuery(QUERY, {
  variables: {
    where: {
      hasActiveConditions: true,
    },
  },
})
```

This parameter filters games that don't have a single active condition to bet on, or in other words, games that have
at least one Condition not in the paused/cancelled status. This ensures that only games with available betting options
are returned in the query results. Most likely you will always use this parameter.


## Fetch Top 10 Games

It's possible to sort games in the query by the volume of bets using the `orderBy` argument in the GraphQL query.
By default, games are sorted by their start time, but you can sort them by other fields such as the total amount of bets
placed on the game.

```graphql
query Games {
  games(
    first: 10,
    orderBy: turnover,
    orderDirection: desc
  ) {
    ...Game
  }
}
```
