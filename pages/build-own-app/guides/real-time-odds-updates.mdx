# Real-time Odds Updates

## Subscribe for odds update

Whenever a bet is placed on an LP (Liquidity Provider) contract, a `NewBet` event is created, causing odds values to change.
By subscribing to this event, the updated odds can be obtained.

In order to display updated odds for each outcome button in the user interface, there is a way to subscribe to
the `NewBet` event for each button.

```ts copy filename="subscriber.ts"
const coreContract = new Contract(CORE_ADDRESS, CORE_ABI, RPC_PROVIDER)

coreContract.on('NewBet', async (...args) => {
  const [ bettor, affiliate, conditionId, tokenId, outcomeId, amount, odds, funds ] = args

  eventEmitter.dispatch('NewBetPlaced', {
    coreAddress: CORE_ADDRESS,
    conditionId,
    outcomeId,
  })
})
```

```ts copy filename="OutcomeButton.ts"
type Outcome = {
  outcomeId: string
  condition: {
    conditionId: string
    coreAddress: string
  }
}

const outcome: Outcome = ...

eventEmitter.subscribe('NewBetPlaced', (event) => {
  if (
    event.coreAddress === outcome.condition.coreAddress
    && event.conditionId === outcome.condition.conditionId
    && event.outcomeId === outcome.outcomeId
  ) {
    // Fetch new odds value
  }
})
```

The information on how to fetch odds values can be found [here](/build-own-app/guides/fetch-odds-values).

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  It's important to note that the `conditionId` and `outcomeId` values on different Core contracts may match.
  Therefore, it's important to do a check at the Core contract address.

## Core Contracts

It is highly probable that you will interact with multiple core contracts simultaneously. In such cases, multiple
subscribers will be required. GraphQL can be utilized to obtain a list of core contract addresses.

```graphql copy
query CoreContracts {
  coreContracts {
    address
  }
}
```

or for specific LP

```graphql copy
query CoreContracts($where: CoreContract_filter) {
  coreContracts(where: $where) {
    address
  }
}
```


## Best Practices

To minimize the cost of sending requests via RPC (Remote Procedure Call) or GraphQL, there is an option to combine
multiple requests into batches.
