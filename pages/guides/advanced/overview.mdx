# Overview

In this section of the documentation, we delve into the realm of manual interaction with the Azuro Protocol.
While the [SDK](/guides/sdk/overview) is designed to meet the diverse needs of our users,
we acknowledge that it might not cater to every specific requirement you may have.

This might be particularly relevant for those with intricate, bespoke, or unique use-cases
that demand a deeper interaction with the protocol and desire to have greater control over the intricacies of the system.

Here, we offer a meticulous exploration into the underlying structure of the Azuro Protocol
and provide elucidative guides to navigate through its manual operational aspects.
We'll present you with comprehensive details on how to manually interact with the protocol's
smart contracts, process transactions, and more.

By the end of this section, you should be proficient in handling the protocol to better
align with your advanced and unique expectations. This will also aid in gaining a more
holistic understanding of how Azuro works, which could be beneficial even for those who
use the SDK most of the time.

Remember, this is your journey, and we're here to support your individual preferences.
With Azuro, you are given the freedom to interact with the system in the way that best works for you.
