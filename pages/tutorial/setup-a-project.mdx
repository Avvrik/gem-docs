# Setup a Project

## Setup Next.js Project

In this guide we use React framework - Next.js. Don't worry if you are not familiar with Next.js. We will use it
as a boilerplate, there will be nothing in the installed project that can cause you difficulties in further coding.

Open your terminal, `cd` into the directory you’d like to create the project, and run the following command:

```bash copy
npx create-next-app@latest ./azuro-betting-app
```

**Note!** During installation a terminal will prompt you with options to select. You need a very simple configuration
for this tutorial

- Would you like to use TypeScript with this project? … **No** / Yes
- Would you like to use ESLint with this project? … **No** / Yes
- Would you like to use `src/` directory with this project? … **No** / Yes
- Would you like to use experimental `app/` directory with this project? … **No** / Yes
- What import alias would you like configured? … @/* **(press Enter to skip)**

You now have a new directory called `azuro-betting-app`. Let’s `cd` into it

```bash
cd azuro-betting-app
```


## Styling

In this tutorial we will use [TailwindCSS](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/styling/tailwind-css) to apply CSS styles to UI.

Execute the following commands in the app root directory

```
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

Update **tailwind.config.js**. Add paths to the files that will use Tailwind CSS, add `.container` styles and breakpoints

```bash copy filename="tailwind.config.js"
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./components/**/*.js",
    "./pages/**/*.js",
  ],
  theme: {
    container: {
      center: true,
      padding: '1rem',
      screens: {
        'sm': '600px',
        'md': '740px',
        'lg': '960px',
        'xl': '1024px',
        '2xl': '1280px',
      },
    },
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

Add the Tailwind CSS directives that Tailwind will use to inject its generated styles to a Global Stylesheet. Also add
some styles for the feature usage.

```css copy filename="styles/globals.css"
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

@layer base {
  input[type="number"]::-webkit-inner-spin-button,
  input[type="number"]::-webkit-outer-spin-button {
    -webkit-appearance: none;
    margin: 0;
  }
}

@layer components {
  .button {
    @apply py-1.5;
    @apply px-4;
    @apply text-white;
    @apply bg-blue-700;
    @apply rounded-md;
  }

  .button[disabled] {
    @apply opacity-50;
    @apply cursor-not-allowed;
  }
}
```


## Packages

Install the packages which will be used during development

```bash copy
npm install @azuro-org/dictionaries @azuro-org/toolkit dayjs
```

<Callout type="info">
  Azuro offers NPM packages: [`@azuro-org/dictionaries`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azuro-org/dictionaries) and
  [`@azuro-org/toolkit`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azuro-org/toolkit).

## Components and Business Logic

Create two folders for organizing project files: "components" for storing the components that will be created
during this tutorial and "hooks" for the business logic.

```bash copy
mkdir components hooks
```


## Clean Up

Clean up the application to prepare for the next steps.

1. Remove `styles/Home.module.css`
2. Remove `pages/api` folder

**Great job! You have completed the setup and are now ready to dive into the exciting world of developing a betting
website on the Azuro protocol. Get creative, explore the possibilities, and build amazing!**
