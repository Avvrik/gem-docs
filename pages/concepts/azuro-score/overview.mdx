Azuro Score points will be convertible into \$AZUR tokens after the \$AZUR token is launched.

The Azuro Score program invites wide community participation and value adds helping ensure the success of Azuro as
critical decentralized betting and gambling infrastructure. It is meant to lay the foundations for sufficient
decentralization of the ecosystem and the governance of Azuro.

To achieve this - it is important that participants are rewarded according to specific value adds. It is possible that
the settings for how many points are awarded for what actions, and the actions themselves can be updated in order to
find better balance in distribution among contributors and optimize for maximum value towards Azuro.


## How to grow your Azuro Score?

You can get Azuro Score points for the actions below:

### Using frontends

Frontends list can be found [here](https://azuro.org/frontends).

**1 USDC/XDAI bet = 5 points**
  - If user’s Azuro Score is smaller than `degressive_level`, then the points from betting are multiplied by `1 + level_boost`.
  - If the user’s Azuro Score is > `degressive_level` but < `2 * degressive_level`, then the points from betting are
  multiplied by: `(2 - sqrt(user’s Azuro Score / degressive_level - 1)) * (1 + level_boost)`
  - If the user’s Azuro Score is > `2 * degressive_level`, then the points from betting are divided by 5. (this setting was different until 11:00AM UTC, March 3, 2023. You can see the old setting here).

**`degressive_level` = 10,000**
<br />**`level_boost` = 100%**

<Callout type="info">
  - Only bets made (time of bet transaction) after Feb 16, 00:01 UTC, 2023 count.
  - Score points are attributed immediately after the settlement of the betting markets. Betting on canceled events/markets will not give points.

### Providing liquidity

Liquidity provision gives points using a function of 2 parameters: amount of liquidity provided & amount of time it is
provided for. Time is measured in 10-day increments. 1 increment is 10 full days. Only full increments count.

**1 USDC/XDAI liquidity for 1 increment of time = 0.3 points** (i.e. 1 USDC/XDAI added liquidity for 2 increments
(at least 20 days) = 0.6 points; 1 USDC/XDAI added liquidity for 35 days = 0.9 points; and so on…)

<Callout type="info">
  - There is no restrictions on adding/withdrawing liquidity. The points are calculated according to the total amount of time liquidity has been provided for.
  - Only liquidity providers (addresses) adding liquidity after Feb 15, 00:01 UTC, 2023 (when Azuro pools were opened to the public) can receive points. If the LP (address) was LPing before this point in time (i.e. private liquidity) - it is excluded from Azuro Score points.
  - Score points are updated/attributed once per day at midnight UTC.

<Callout type="warning">
  The settings can be changed in the future. Should this happen all changes will be announced promptly. It is expected
  that there may be a Stage 2 of the Azuro Score before the launch of the $AZUR Token.

## Since when is the Azuro Score live?

**The Azuro Score is live since 16 Feb, 2023 00:01 UTC with no end date decided yet.**

You can check your score [here](https://www.azuro.org/score).
