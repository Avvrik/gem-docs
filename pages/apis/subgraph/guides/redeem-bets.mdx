# Redeem Bets

When a user places a bet on Azuro, their tokens are transferred to the [LP](/contracts/lp) contract, and they receive
a non-fungible token (NFT) called `AzuroBet-NFT` as proof of their bet.

Once the outcome is resolved, users whose bets have won can redeem their winnings by calling the `withdrawPayout` function
in the LP contract and providing the `betId` of the bet they want to redeem. If a game or a specific condition on the
outcome of which a bet was made is canceled, users can retrieve their tokens back by calling the same function.

The bet NFT also serves as a way to display users' betting history and allows them to track their bets and winnings.


## Redeem a bet

```ts
withdrawPayout(
  core: string,
  tokenId: BigNumberish,
  isNative: boolean,
  overrides?: Overrides & { from?: string }
): Promise<ContractTransaction>
```

```graphql
query Bets {
  bets {
    betId
    core {
      address
      liquidityPool {
        address
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```ts
const isNativeToken = appChainId === Gnosis.chainId

const tx = await lpContract.connect(signer).withdrawPayout(
  bet.core.address,
  bet.betId,
  isNativeToken
)
```

`coreAddress` is required to specify on which `Core` contract user wants to redeem the bet.


## Batch Redeem

To redeem multiple bets at once, you can use `withdrawPayouts` method on the `ProxyFront` smart contract.

```ts
withdrawPayouts(
  lp: PromiseOrValue<string>,
  data: IProxyFront.WithdrawPayoutDataStruct[],
  isNative: PromiseOrValue<boolean>,
  overrides?: Overrides & { from?: PromiseOrValue<string> }
): Promise<ContractTransaction>
```

```ts
const isNativeToken = appChainId === Gnosis.chainId

const data = bets.map(({ coreAddress, betId }) => ({
  core: coreAddress,
  tokenId: betId,
}))

const tx = await proxyFrontContract.connect(signer).withdrawPayouts(
  lpContract.address,
  data,
  isNativeToken
)
```
