# Setup a Project

## Setup Next.js Project

In this guide we use React framework - Next.js. Don't worry if you are not familiar with Next.js. We will use it
as a boilerplate, there will be nothing in the installed project that can cause you difficulties in further coding.

Create a project with the following command:

```bash copy
npx create-next-app@latest ./azuro-bookmaker-website
```

**Note!** During installation a terminal will prompt you with options to select. You need a very simple configuration
for this tutorial

- Would you like to use TypeScript with this project? … **No** / Yes
- Would you like to use ESLint with this project? … **No** / Yes
- Would you like to use `src/` directory with this project? … **No** / Yes
- Would you like to use experimental `app/` directory with this project? … **No** / Yes
- What import alias would you like configured? … @/* **(press Enter to skip)**

Now you can run the app in development mode

```bash
cd azuro-bookmaker-website
npm run dev
```

Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see Next.js initial page.


## Styling

In this tutorial we will use [TailwindCSS](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/styling/tailwind-css) to apply CSS styles to UI.

Execute the following commands in the app root directory

```
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

Update **tailwind.config.js**. Add paths to the files that will use Tailwind CSS, add `.container` styles and breakpoints

```bash {4,7-17} copy
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./pages/*.js",
  ],
  theme: {
    container: {
      center: true,
      padding: '1rem',
      screens: {
        'sm': '600px',
        'md': '740px',
        'lg': '960px',
        'xl': '1024px',
        '2xl': '1280px',
      },
    },
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

Add the Tailwind CSS directives that Tailwind will use to inject its generated styles to a Global Stylesheet.

Replace the CSS code in `styles/globals.css` with

```css copy
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

To save time in the future, let's add additional styles in the same file

```css copy {4-14}
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

@layer components {
  .button {
    @apply py-1.5;
    @apply px-4;
    @apply text-blue-700;
    @apply border;
    @apply border-blue-700;
    @apply rounded-md;
  }
}
```


## Clean Up

Let's clean up the application to prepare for the next steps.

1. Remove `styles/Home.module.css`
2. Remove `pages/api` folder
3. Replace code in `pages/index.js` with
```tsx copy
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main />
  )
}
```
