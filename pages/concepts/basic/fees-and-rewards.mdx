# Fees & Rewards

The term "fee" within Azuro protocol refers to the percentage of the [Pool](/concepts/protocol/pools)'s profit that is
distributed as rewards to those who contribute to its operation.

Currently, there are three types of contributors in the Pool, each with a corresponding fee: [Azuro DAO](/concepts/governance/overview) fee,
[Data Provider](/concepts/basic/data-providers) fee, and [Affiliate](/concepts/basic/affiliates) fee. The part of the
profit and loss that is not distributed among these three participants remains to be allocated to the [LP](/contracts/lp)
liquidity deposits.

Azuro DAO and Data Providers have the same reward mechanism: after the completion of each [Condition](/concepts/protocol/conditions),
the profit or loss of the pool is multiplied by the fee rate and added to the contributor reward balance. If the balance
is positive and enough time has passed since the previous withdrawal, the contributor can withdraw their due reward.

The Affiliate reward mechanism differs from that of Azuro DAO and Data Providers. At the moment, in all
[Betting Engines](/concepts/protocol/betting-engines), Affiliates only share in Pool's profits, but not losses. The
calculation of Affiliate rewards is determined individually by each Betting Engine. For example, because profit
calculation for [PrematchCore](/contracts/prematch-core) Affiliates is a gas-expensive operation, in withdrawal requests,
Affiliates also provide a list of Condition IDs for which they want to get their reward.

Currently Azuro Pool  liquidity providers get the majority share of pool's profits. However, it is expected that the
settings will be updated as per the table below, as usage increases.

| Actor | % share of profit* | Address |
|---|---|---|
| [Liquidity Providers](/concepts/basic/liquidity-providers) | 25 | N/A |
| [Affiliates (Frontends)](/concepts/basic/affiliates) | 60 | N/A |
| [Data Providers](/concepts/basic/data-providers) | 10 | `0x77e803ad3a4a52d5ab609451b8ba60cea7a5bea6` |
| [Azuro DAO](/concepts/governance/overview) | 5 | `0xef18f2f054a7ad2909333051aa42d5c0bb3f92f6` |

<Callout icon="*" type="reference">
  In the current implementation, Frontends only share in the Pool's profitable conditions but not the losing ones,
  which makes it difficult to precisely predict profit sharing % (i.e. it may deviate from the expected settings above,
  depending on performance). An update which allows for precise setting of profit distribution is planned for Q4, 2023.
