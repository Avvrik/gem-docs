Welcome to the section of our Azuro documentation where we guide you on creating and customizing your very own frontend.
Harness the power of the Azuro Protocol, create a new betting interface or enhance an existing one.

As we move forward, we'll cover specific aspects of frontend development in detail, offering step-by-step instructions, and providing real-world examples to make your journey smoother.

Embrace the opportunity to innovate and create a meaningful impact in the betting industry with Azuro!

## Before we start

### Base knowledge
- JavaScript;
- Web3 ([wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/), [ethers](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/single-page/#getting-started), or other similar lib);
- GraphQL\
If you want to do manual requests instead of SDK.\
See [specificities of the subgraph and Azuro protocol entities here](/subgraph/highlights).

### `affiliate` parameter (address)

This is the wallet address where the rewards will be distributed. Please be aware that the accumulation of rewards is predicated on them being associated with this specific wallet. Use the wallet address as the **`affiliate`** parameter in placing bet transactions. [Read about rewards distribution here](/concepts/basic/rewards).


```js {1, 8}
  const AFFILIATE_ADDRESS = '0x...' // Your wallet address to earn rewards

  lp.bet(
  core,
  amount,
  deadline,
  {
    affiliate: AFFILIATE_ADDRESS,
    data,
    minOdds
  }
  )
```

### Build own app

Developing your own betting application using our guides and documentation often involves about a week's worth of effort due to the complexity of the logic involved. To streamline this process, we developed an SDK for quicker application development.

SDK provides a comprehensive collection of useful React hooks and utilities for creating your own betting application, eliminating the need to worry about the tedious setup details.

If you want to use it, complete our step-by-step [Tutorial](/guides/tutorial) to know it better.
