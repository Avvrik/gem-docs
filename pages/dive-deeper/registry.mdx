This article describes how to work with bet markets, outcomes. We recommend to skip this article and return to it after
you explore all other stuff. Just keep in mind that it exists.

## Outcomes

Each game may have many outcomes related to markets, e.g. football event can have set of:

- Both Team To Score: Yes | No
- Full Time Result: 1 | 2
- etc

Each outcome has `outcomeId`. Blockchain doesn't store an information about outcomes. Using this id you can retrieve
all the information about outcomes from the protocol [dictionaries](https://github.com/Azuro-protocol/public-config/tree/main/dictionaries/v2/maps).

First of all you need to get related ids. You need [outcomes.json](https://github.com/Azuro-protocol/public-config/blob/main/dictionaries/v2/maps/outcomes.json)
to do this. The file contains the map of data with the interface:

```ts
type OutcomeId = number

Map<OutcomeId, {
  selectionId: number
  marketId: number
  gamePeriodId: number
  gameTypeId: number
  gameVarietyId: number
  pointsId: number
  teamPlayerId: number
  _comment: string
}>
```

Using related ids you can receive additional info from other files, use `selectionId` for `selections.json`,
`marketId` for `markets.json` , etc.

This will be useful for displaying information about the event and outcomes in the UI.
