# Redeem Bets

When a user places a bet on Azuro, their tokens are transferred to the `LP` contract and they receive an NFT
(non-fungible token) called `BetNft` in return. This NFT serves as proof of the user's bet and allows them to claim
their winnings. Once the outcome is resolved, the `LP` contract will distribute the winnings to the users who placed
winning bets. The BetNft can then be redeemed for the user's share of the winnings.

If a game or a specific condition on the outcome of which a bet was made is canceled, the user can retrieve their
tokens by calling the `withdrawPayout` function in the `LP` contract. This function takes as input the `betId` of the
bet that the user wants to redeem.

```ts
withdrawPayout(
  core: string,
  tokenId: BigNumberish,
  isNative: boolean,
  overrides?: Overrides & { from?: string }
): Promise<ContractTransaction>
```

## Usage

```graphql
query Bets {
  bets {
    betId
    core {
      address
      liquidityPool {
        address
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```ts
const isNativeToken = appChainId === Gnosis.chainId

const tx = await lpContract.connect(signer).withdrawPayout(
  bet.core.address,
  bet.betId,
  isNativeToken
)
```

`coreAddress` is required to specify on which `Core` contract user wants to redeem the bet.
