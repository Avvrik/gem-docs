This article will provide a comprehensive list of React components that can be used to build a customizable and
user-friendly interface for your betting application. These components will include the Games List, Navigation,
Bets History, and Betslip, among others. The components can be easily styled using CSS variables, providing a high level
of flexibility for your application's design.

In addition to the React components, Azuro will provide the NPM package - a framework built on top of NextJS that
provides a streamlined setup process for projects that incorporate Azuro components and GraphQL. With NextJS, developers
can get their projects up and running in minutes, without having to worry about the tedious details of setup
and configuration.
