import { Callout } from 'components'

# Overview

SDK provides a comprehensive collection of useful React hooks and utilities for creating your own betting application, eliminating the need to worry about the tedious setup details.

<Callout type="info">
In the future you can meet these types and in order not to repeat, we'll provide descriptions here.

- **Selection**: Represents the user's choise, main data for bet and odds calculation, etc.
- **Outcome**: Specific data, such as the user's bet (`BetOutcome`) that includes `Selection`.

```ts
type Selection = {
  conditionId: string | bigint
  outcomeId: string | bigint
}
```

```ts
type BetOutcome = {
  selectionName: string
  odds: number
  marketName: string
  game: GameQuery['games'][0]
  isWin: boolean | null
  isLose: boolean | null
  isCanceled: boolean
} & Selection
```
