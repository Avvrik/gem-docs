# Overview

The tools available in this section are designed to streamline common tasks, reduce development time, and improve the
efficiency of the development process. They provide developers with easy-to-use functions and utilities, as well as
access to pre-built data sets and libraries.

Developers can use these tools to work with Azuro Protocol more easily, leveraging the power of the protocol without
needing to understand the underlying smart contracts in detail. The packages available in this section are continually
updated and maintained to ensure they remain up-to-date with the latest developments in the protocol.
