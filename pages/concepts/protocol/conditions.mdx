# Conditions

In the design of the Azuro protocol, each market presented on a [Pool](/concepts/protocol/pools) is called a Condition.

Conditions are managed by [data providers](/concepts/basic/data-providers) and contain information about the
game it is associated with, reinforcement, margin and bets, funds, odds, and potential
payouts for each outcome.

The following is an example of data used in a [pre-match](/contracts/prematch-core) Condition:

```json
{
  "gameId": 1567913801,
  "funds": [ 9042226398630705800000, 8942920756775340683000 ],  // The outcome fund is equal to the total volume of bets on the Condition + reinforcement - potential payouts in the event of the opposing outcome winning
  "virtualFunds": [ 3444665423020949702439, 5540481732385096780561 ], // Used to calculate odds
  "reinforcement": 9000000000000000000000,
  "affiliatesReward": 0, // The Condition turned out to be unprofitable
  "outcomes": [ 6977, 6978 ],
  "outcomeWin": 6977,
  "margin": 75000000000, // 7.5%
  "oracle": "0x67f15dD0AbA990362607B11C52A1d920b732580a", // Condition creator address
  "state": 1, // Resolved
  "leaf": 1099511627964 // The leaf of Liquidity Tree
}
```
