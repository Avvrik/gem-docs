# Overview

Sdk provides a comprehensive collection of handy React hooks and utils for creating your own betting application without having to worry about the tedious details of setup.

## Main concept

We have two entity:

- **Selection**: Represents main data for bet, calculation odds and etc.
- **Outcome**: Specific data, for example `BetOutcome` that includes `Selection`.

```ts
type Selection = {
  conditionId: string | bigint
  outcomeId: string | bigint
}
```

```ts
type BetOutcome = {
  selectionName: string
  odds: number
  marketName: string
  game: GameQuery['games'][0]
  isWin: boolean | null
  isLose: boolean | null
  isCanceled: boolean
} & Selection
```
