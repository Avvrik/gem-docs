Welcome to the Azuro guide on creating your custom frontend. This guide will help you leverage the Azuro Protocol for building a new betting interface or enhancing an existing one. We'll provide detailed instructions and real-world examples to streamline your development process.

## Prerequisites

### Before starting, ensure you have a basic understanding of:
- JavaScript;
- Web3 ([wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/), [ethers](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/single-page/#getting-started), or other similar lib);
- GraphQL\
If you want to make manual requests instead of using the SDK.\
Learn about [the subgraph and Azuro protocol entities here](/subgraph/highlights).

### Getting Rewards (Affiliate Wallet)

To direct rewards to your wallet, include your wallet address as the `affiliate` parameter in bet transactions. [Read about rewards distribution here](/concepts/basic/rewards).

```js {1, 8}
  const AFFILIATE_ADDRESS = '0x...' // Your wallet address to earn rewards

  lp.bet(
  core,
  amount,
  deadline,
  {
    affiliate: AFFILIATE_ADDRESS,
    data,
    minOdds
  }
  )
```
