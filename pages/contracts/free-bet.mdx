The FreeBet contract enables users to place free bets on any [PrematchCore](/contracts/prematch-core) contract.
Each FreeBet has specific attributes, including a denomination, expiration time, and minimum betting odds requirement.
Additionally, each FreeBet contract is limited to a particular affiliate address to offer free bets exclusively to their
customers. It's important to note that when a free bet wins, the bettor receives only the difference between the winnings
and the original bet amount.

## Key Features

### 1. Bet Placement
The FreeBet contract handles everything related to placing the granted bet on behalf of the user.

### 2. Withdraw Winnings
Users can withdraw their winnings from the [LP](/contracts/lp) through the FreeBet contract.

## Limitation to Affiliate Address
To ensure that free bets are granted only to specific customers, the FreeBet contract restricts the distribution to
a certain affiliate address.

## Claimable Feature
The FreeBet distribution process is cost-effective for frontend operators. Customers will cover the gas fees for the
`bet` transaction, and the claim fee will be included as part of this process. This reduces the operational
costs associated with distributing free bets.

[Free Bets Distribution Guide](/contracts/guides/distribute-freebets).
